    ## Repository description
    	This Git repository is storing some web stuff I developed in spring 2015 with Comp20 class
    ## Favorite assignment
    	My favorite assignment is the mmap.(It is cool to see where your friends are!) Because it is a good practice with front end javascript programming. With the help of different APIs, I can now develop any website I want. (No database of course)
    ## The journey
    	When I first entered Comp20 classroom, I had never been exposed to any programming skills related to web. Now I am very comfortable developing a website that I want. And I know how to resolve issues related to web programming. Although there are still a lot of new web technology out there, but I am on the trek now.
    ## Most important things I learned
    	*	Never re-invent the wheel! Use express framework to make life easier.
    	*	Never trust user input! The security report I wrote lists so many security issues if not checking user input
    ## For future
    	I will continue my journey in web developing and write my own web app!
